## Description of datasets

#### Handwritten Digit Recognition
The datset for digit recognition is from the MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) of handwritten digits consisting of a training set (60.000 images) and a test set (10.000 images). The images are size-normalized (28Ã—28 pixels) and centered, and stored as csv (comma-separated values) files. Each line of these files represents an image. The first column represents the label (the digit depicted in the image).
